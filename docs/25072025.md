# fix(websocket): send real-time AI fallback notification to user on agent disconnect

# - When an agent's WebSocket connection is closed, all sessions assigned to that agent with mode 'human' are now updated to 'ai'.
# - Immediately notifies the corresponding user's WebSocket connection with {"sender": "system", "mode": "ai"}.
# - Ensures the user interface switches to "You are now chatting with AI" in real time, without requiring a page refresh.
# - Improves real-time agent/AI switching and overall user experience.
